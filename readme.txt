This folder shows 3 different ways to write a program.

store_item.rb uses hashes and arrays to arrange and print data on store items.

store_item_oop.rb shows us arranging our store items with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). We also learned
how to use inheritance in this file.

the files food.rb, item.rb and main.rb use OOP, inheritance, and modules to keep our code even neater and
more "compartmentalized" .
